# How the Userguide works

The userguide uses [Markdown](markdown) for the documentation.  Both the userguide pages, and the in code comments for the API browser are written in markdown.

### Userguide pages

Userguide pages are in the module they apply to, in `guide/<module>`. For example, documentation for Laravel is in `Userguide/guide/laravel`.

Each module has an index page at `guide/<module>/index.md`.

Each module's menu is at `guide/<module>/documentation.md`.

All other pages are are in `guide/<module>` and can be organized in subfolders and named however you want.

For more info on how to make your module have userguide pages, see [Adding your module](adding).
